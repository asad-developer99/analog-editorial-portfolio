# 3d CAMERA WEBSITE

An interactive, high-fidelity 3D analog photography portfolio and digital darkroom experience. Built with WebGL, Three.js, and modern front-end techniques to showcase 35mm mechanical cameras, film anatomy, and editorial visual archives.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive 3D Camera Experience**: Real-time 3D rendered Canon F-1 mechanical SLR camera model (`.glb`) with interactive inspection, orbit controls, and smooth WebGL lighting.
- **Anatomy of 35mm Film**: Visual layer-by-layer breakdown demonstrating the photographic emulsion process (anti-halation layer, subbing layer, RGB light-sensitive layers, and protective coat).
- **Editorial & Analog Gallery**: High-resolution showcase of 35mm film captures, human portraits, architecture, and cinematic street photography.
- **Atmospheric Darkroom Aesthetic**: Thoughtfully curated monochrome and warm amber palette inspired by classic darkroom workflows.
- **Zero-Dependency Local Server**: Built-in lightweight Node.js HTTP server with custom MIME support for `.glb` 3D assets, high-res textures, and web standards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3
- **3D & WebGL**: Three.js, GLTFLoader, OrbitControls
- **Assets**: 3D GLTF/GLB Models, High-Res 35mm Film Textures, Web Fonts
- **Local Dev Server**: Node.js (`http`, `fs`, `path`)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (static hosting)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher recommended)

### Installation & Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asad-developer99/analog-editorial-portfolio.git
   cd analog-editorial-portfolio
   ```

2. **Start the local server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> Note: This project is a static site (no build step, no framework). `server.js` is provided purely as a convenience for local development — it's not required in production, since the site is deployed as static files.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This project deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as a static site. Key configuration:

- `vercel.json` sets `outputDirectory` to the project root — no build command needed.
- `server.js` is only used for local development and is not invoked in production.
